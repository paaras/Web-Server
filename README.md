Compiling
---------
The program is composed of only one source file so itâ€™s quite easy to compile. You can choose to invoke the gcc command:
$ gcc serverfork.c -o serverfork
Or just use the included Makefile:
$ make
gcc serverfork.c -o serverfork
The Makefile comes with the added benefit of having a make clean option which will automatically delete the application and any object files.
$ make clean
To run the program simply type ./serverfork and the port number:
./serverfork 12345
